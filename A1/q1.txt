Question1

Part a)

when cat answer.txt, there is no read permission

command to diagnose failures:

$cd Downloads/206_assign1_provided/Problem1
$ls -l

the outcome shows that answer.txt does not have any permission (especially, no read permission)

$test -r answer.txt
$echo $?

the outcome 1 shows also that there is no read permission for file answer.txt

Part b)
assume im already in /Problem1 from part a)


$chmod u+r answer.txt
$cat answer.txt

This file contains a message with the answer to part 1. The message is:

"Look what I learned in 206!"

Congratulations if you read this.
